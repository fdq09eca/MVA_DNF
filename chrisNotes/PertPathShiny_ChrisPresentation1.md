## What this presentation will do?

In the presentation, I will tell you about...

1. what is my task.
2. what did I do.
3. what difficulties I met.
4. what the code does.
5. what is the implementation.
6. how I read `*.gmt` into R.
7. what am I going to do.

---

## My task

Optimize the code to take in several pathways from `MSigDB`.

- Read in GMT files of pathways :ballot_box_with_check: 
- Recompute $D_{pathway}$ for each pathway of interest :ballot_box_with_check: 
- Re-execute permutation testing & z-score calculation
- Generate top drug hits against query drugs
- Show communities arising per pathway (see `DNF` herokuapp)

---

## What did I do?

1. I setup the development environment
2. I read and try to understand the following codes:
   1. `DeenaGendoo_Generate_MVA_DNF.R` :ballot_box_with_check: 
   2. `DeenaGendoo_PermutationTestAndFiltering.R` 
3. I read `KEGG.gmt` into R.

---

## What difficulties I met?

I am on a M1 BigSur

----

- Compatibility issue.
- Do not buy M1 until your stuffs are ready for M1. [name=Chris, 2021]

---

## What I understood from the code

- :spiral_note_pad: **Code**: `DeenaGendoo_Generate_MVA_DNF.R`
- :dart:  **Goal**: To have an network that allows drugs comparison for a specific biochemical pathway.
- :hammer_and_wrench: **Methodology**: Create an _integrated network_ for the _mevalonate pathway_ that shows all the relationships between drugs and themselves by constructing different _network layers_ from the given `PrePros.RData`.
- :file_folder: **Output**: Save the _integrated network_ and constructed _layers_ to a `MVA_DNF.RData`

----

### Terminologies :books:

> What is _mevalonate pathway_?

- _mevalonate pathway_ (`mva`) is a biochemical pathway.
- `MVA_genes.csv` are the genes involved in the `mva`

----

> What are _network layers_?

- Essentially, they are all correlation matrices of drugs, i.e. `drug-drug correlation matrix`.
- They describe the drugs similarity with respect to different profiles i.e. data set. which are the followings:
  - **Perturbation profile**: Perturbation between **Drug** and **Gene**
  - **Sensitivity profile**: Sensitivity between **Drug** and **Cell line**
  - **Drug Structure profile**: Structure between **Drug** and **Drug**
- They are converted to an _Affinity Matrix_ for the networks integration eventually.

----

> What is _integrated network_?

- It is the main goal.
- It is, still, a `drug-drug correlation matrix`.
- It is integrated by the following 3 network layers _Affinity Matrix_:
  1. Drug Perturbation: `pertAffMat`
  2. Drug Sensitivity: `sensAffMat`
  3. Drug Structure: `strcAffMat`
- It uses _similarity network fusion (SNF)_ method to integrate different networks.
- It shows all the relationships between drugs and themselves

### Data: `PrePros.RData`

|    obj     |          `class(.)`          |       shape        |          Description           |   source     |
| :--------: | :--------------------------: | :----------------: | :----------------------------: | :---------: |
| `pertData` |       `matrix, array`        | row: 978, col: 238 |   **Drug-Gene** Perturbation   | LINCS-L1000 |
| `sensData` |       `matrix, array`        |  row: 60, col:238  | **Drug-Cell line** Sensitivity |   NCI-60    |
| `strcData` | `list`, `fingerprint object` |    length: 238     |      **Drugs** Structure       |

----

### `FunctionBank.R`

It contains functions that ...
- constuct the respective network layers
  - `constPerturbationLayer(pertDat)`
  - `constSensitivityLayer(sensDat)`
  - `constStructureLayer(strcDat)`
- intgerate the network layers
  - `integrateStrctSensPert(sensAff, strcAff, pertAff)`

----

### `MVA_gene.csv`

- It contains the genes that involve in the `mva` pathway.

:::info
:warning: In the future development, it will be replaced by other `*.gmt` such that we can build networks for other pathways
:::

---

## Implementation :pushpin:

`DeenaGendoo_Generate_MVA_DNF.R` does the following:

1. Load packages
2. :star: Read and load the target biochemical pathway, i.e. read `MVA_genes.csv` to `mva` object.
4. Extract the gene names that involved in `mav`, i.e. `mvagenes`.
5. Reduce the gene in `pertData` to `mvagenes`.
6. Reduce the drugs in all data sets to that remains in `pertData`, i.e keep the drug that related to `mva`.
7. :star: Construct network layers for Structure, Sensitivity and Perturbation: `strcAffMat`, `sensAffMat`, `pertAffMat`.
8. :star: Integrate all the network layers to a single integrated network: `integrtStrctSensPert`
9. Save all layers and the integrated network to a `.RData`.

----

### Gist :star:

- The main things happens at :two:, :six:, and :seven:
- :two: reads in the specific biochemcal pathway from `MVA_genes.csv`
  - It will be replaced by `*.GMT` files later for other pathways.
  - I will obtain `*.GMT` from **MSigDB**.
- :six: contructs the networks layers
- :seven: integerates the networks layers that contructed in :six:.

----

### Network layers and integeration

Practically, It is the following snippet:

```r
strcAffMat <- constStructureLayer(strcData)
sensAffMat <- constSensitivityLayer(sensData)
pertAffMat <- constPerturbationLayer(pertData)
integrtStrctSensPert <- integrateStrctSensPert(sensAffMat, strcAffMat, pertAffMat)
```

# Reading `*.gmt`

- I use [`GSA`][gsa_r_doc_link]
:::info
:information_source: 
Description:

     Read in a gene set collection from a .gmt file

Usage:

     GSA.read.gmt(filename)

Value:

A list with components

     genesets: List of gene names (identifiers) in each gene set,
     geneset.names: Vector of gene set names (identifiers),
     geneset.descriptions: Vector of gene set descriptions

:::

[gsa_r_doc_link]: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GSA/index.html

----

## Let's take `kegg.gmt` as an example.

---

## `kegg.gmt` description

:::info
:information_source: 
- [`c2.cp.kegg.v7.4.symbols.gmt`][kegg_gmt_download_link]
- Canonical Pathways gene sets derived from the KEGG pathway database.
- 186 gene set i.e pathways.

---

### Reading `kegg.gmt` into R in action

```r
r$> library(GSA)
r$> kegg <- GSA.read.gmt("Data/GMT/c2.cp.kegg.v7.4.symbols.gmt")

r$> length(kegg$geneset.names)
[1] 186

r$> kegg$geneset.names[1]
[1] "KEGG_N_GLYCAN_BIOSYNTHESIS"
```

----

#### `kegg$geneset.names[1]` genesets

```r
r$> kegg$genesets[[1]]
[1] "ALG13"   "DOLPP1"  "RPN1"    "ALG14"   "MAN1B1"  "ALG3"    "B4GALT1" "MGAT5"  
[9] "RPN2"    "STT3A"   "MGAT3"   "DAD1"    "MGAT2"   "ALG12"   "TUSC3"   "MAN1C1" 
[17] "DPM2"    "DPM1"    "GANAB"   "ALG1"    "MGAT4A"  "ALG10B"  "STT3B"   "MAN1A2"

```

## Replacing `mvagenes`

Notice that `mvagenes` is a list of `character`, see below.

```r
r$> mva <- read.csv("Data/MVA_genes.csv")        

r$> class(mva)                                   
[1] "data.frame"

r$> mvagenes <- as.character(sort(mva$Gene.name))

r$> class(mvagenes)                              
[1] "character"

r$> mvagenes                                     
 [1] "ACAT2"  "ACLY"   "ACSS2"  "DPAGT1" "FDFT1" 
 [6] "FDPS"   "GGPS1"  "HMGCR"  "HMGCS1" "INSIG1"
[11] "LDLR"   "MVD"    "MVK"    "SREBP2"

r$> mvagenes[1]                                  
[1] "ACAT2"
```

----

### `mvagenes` equivalent `kegg$genesets`

- to replace `mvagenes` by the equivalent `kegg$genesets` , we should use `kegg$genesets[[i]]` but _NOT_ `kegg$genesets[i]`, where `1 <= i <= 186`
- see difference below:

```r
r$> class(kegg$genesets[[1]])                    
[1] "character"

r$> class(kegg$genesets[1])                      
[1] "list"
```

## what am I going to do?

I will...

- Try to read the rest of `*.gmt` files for the pathways
  - `c2.cp.kegg.v7.4.symbols.gmt`
  - `c2.cp.reactome.v7.4.symbols.gmt`
- Try to replicate the DNF for pathways in `*.gmt`
- continue reading the `DeenaGendoo_PermutationTestAndFiltering.R`

---

## Thank you for your attention

---

## Dr. Deena's suggestion

```r
DNFlist <- list
DNFlist[[1]] <- DNF(pathway1)
names(DNFlist[[1]]) â€” name of the pathways
```
